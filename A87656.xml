            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And whereas they ≈øay in their Letter, <hi>That he accu≈øeth his Brethren and renders them to the World as a People not fit to hold Communion with; and that there are more damnable Here≈øies and Errors cloaked among≈øt the</hi> Quakers <hi>there</hi> (viz. in <hi>Penn≈øilvania) than in any</hi> Prote≈øtant <hi>Society in</hi> Chri≈øtendom.</p>

               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Oh! the gro≈øs Partiality and Inju≈øtice of the≈øe men! when was it that <hi>G.

Keith,</hi> for he ≈øpoke them in a private Meeting at a private hou≈øe in <hi>Burlington,</hi> where about 20 men called Mini≈øters were met; and had they been wi≈øe they would not have ≈øo publickly accu≈øed <hi>G. K.</hi> for them in their ≈øaid Paper, which though they did not print, yet cau≈øed it to be read at Monthly &amp; Quarterly Meetings, and at other Meetings on fir≈øt days and week days, where many that did not profe≈øs to be <hi>Quakers</hi> were pre≈øent, whereby it was noi≈øed all about; and <hi>G. K.</hi> was publickly oppo≈øed and interrupted in his Te≈øtimony in mo≈øt places, and when he prayed in Meetings, many kept on their Hats, and all becau≈øe of this Paper of fal≈øe Judgment again≈øt him by the 28. and it is but a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance whether a thing be printed or not, ≈øeeing they publi≈øhed it all over the Country, and ≈øent it to mo≈øt parts in <hi>America</hi> where there is of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> before <hi>G. K.</hi> publi≈øhed it in print; ≈øo they were the Publi≈øhers of it, and not <hi>G. K.</hi> And this is ≈øufficient to di≈øcover their Partiality and Inju≈øtice in this particular, which is the principal thing they pretend to have again≈øt him.</p>
            <p>Again, whereas they blame him for <hi>Seperating from Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:</hi> by this it plainly appeareth that they own ≈øuch to be their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who are guilty of denying and oppo≈øing <hi>Faith in the Man Chri≈øt without us,</hi> which the≈øe here have done. And for the Seperation which our Oppo≈øers fir≈øt made, and were the cau≈øe of, we are well warranted by the holy Scripture, that ≈øaith, <hi>Come out from among them, and be ye ≈øeperate; Be ye not unequally yoked with <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nbelievers; what fellow≈øhip hath a Believer with an Infidel?</hi> and ≈øuch indeed are all them who have not Faith in the <hi>Man Christ without them,</hi> as in <hi>Chri≈øt in them,</hi> as the≈øe our Oppo≈øers have not, who ≈øet up the <hi>Light within</hi> to be <hi>≈øufficient without any thing el≈øe,</hi> as their Judgment again≈øt him plainly expre≈ø≈øeth, ≈øo excluding the <hi>Man Christ Je≈øus without us</hi> from having any part in our Salvation</p>
            <p>Again, they tell <hi>G. K. That if any of them had been guilty of the≈øe things, he ought to have laboured their Recovery in love and in the Spirit of Meekne≈øs.</hi>

               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> And ≈øo he did for above a year, with much love and patience and met with great Contradiction, Hatred and reviling Language from them for his pains: and he did bear and ≈øuffer ≈øo long, that he could not with peace of Con≈øcience ≈øuffer it any longer, and brought the matter of Difference orderly from one Meeting to another, but there was no Remedy. And whereas they ≈øay, <hi>He ought to have ≈øtated the Difference and ≈øent it to</hi> London: He did write to <hi>G.
